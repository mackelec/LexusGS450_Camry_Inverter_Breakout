# LexusGS450_Camry_Inverter_Breakout
Breakout PCB to the Lexus GS450 / Camry Inverter

###  Introduction

I wanted to use Camry inverters for several projects outside of EV conversions.  I have collected a couple of units and was proded into action by a Topic started by user ThatGuyoverThere on the Openinverter forum.

###  Acknoledgement and Thanks

The intelligence collected and reverse engineering by many, on  https://openinverter.org/forum/ are :

  *  username XP677
  
I apologise if I have left you out.

###  Objective

The objective is to design the breakout board to replace the Toyota logic board and allow further experimentation.  All pins have been broken out into easy to use SIL headers.  The use of this PCB can be the basis of Inverters, power supplies etc.

### Files
