# LexusGS450_Camry_Inverter_Breakout
Breakout PCB to the Lexus GS450 / Camry Inverter

###  Introduction

I wanted to use Camry inverters for several projects outside of EV conversions.  I have collected a couple of units and was proded into action by a Topic started by user ThatGuyoverThere on the Openinverter forum.

###  Acknoledgement and Thanks

The intelligence collected and reverse engineering by many, on  https://openinverter.org/forum/ are :
  *  Damien Maguire
  *  username ThatGuyOverThere
  *  username XP677
  
I apologise if I have left you out.

###  I had my PCB made at www.jlcpcb.com  

To get this PCB made at JLCPCB just use the Zipped Gerbers https://github.com/mackelec/LexusGS450_Camry_Inverter_Breakout/blob/main/Gerber_Camry%20Breakout%20Ver%200.zip

###  Objective

The objective is to design the breakout board to replace the Toyota logic board and allow further experimentation.  All pins have been broken out into easy to use SIL headers.  The use of this PCB can be the basis of Inverters, power supplies etc.

### Files

  *  DXF file is the outline of the Toyota Logic PCB with Connector and mount hole positions.
  *  PDF datasheets of the 50 way JST and the 8 & 16 way JST connector.
  *  PDF - Schematics.
    
    * Page 1 - The Toyota Driver Interface connectors - shows the intellegence we think we know and don't know.
    * Page 2 - XP677's Boost Control using Arduino Nano. https://openinverter.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=538 
    and ULN2003 to drive MG1 & MG2 - the order is to suit my requirements.
